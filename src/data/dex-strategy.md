   comment = Poliwrath here is a very flexible mon that goes all in and doesn't care about nobody except proper support to enable it to go first and destroy. 
   
   Change nature to Brave if you need it in a slow team with trick room (you may need Curse for this instead of Belly Drum to get the best of it) or add Rain Dance/Drizzle support if you need speed (this also means that replacing 252 evs in HP for Speed may be a thing needed in some cases). 
   
   Change Power Fists to Iron Fist against high spdef mons. Believe in Hypnosis to enable you to Belly Drum safe and Close Combat everything (your main move boosted by Power Fists/Iron Fists that will one-shot a lot of mons after Belly Drum).
   
   Substitute can be used instead of Hypnosis if you want something a bit more safe (hp lost hurts tho). Frustration is the cover move against most Psychic mons. Wave Crash/Waterfall/Ice Punch are good alternatives to Frustration in case you need more options.

   Sandstorm is also a possibility and makes it completely impossible for other Pokémon to outspeed Heliolisk. Even though this Pokémon is basically invincible, be aware of priority moves and Pokémon that ignore abilities.

With its Multiscale ability, Dragonite possesses a unique advantage in enduring even the most devastating attacks from opposing Pokemon. In the event that Dragonite sustains damage from a super effective move, its strategic employment of the Weakness Policy item will activate, granting Dragonite a substantial boost to its offensive prowess.

This combination of abilities and items greatly enhances Dragonite's overall effectiveness in battle, making it a potent choice for any trainer seeking a powerhouse on their team.

You can replace Scope Lens with Bright Powder for a bit more of annoyance or continue believing in the power of critical hits and misses to win. 4-5 critical hits should take care of most mons IF you're lucky enough to get there.
   
   If you're tired of it (a.k.a. if the enemy is faster than you), you can simply do cheap damage with Fake Out plus debuff with Parting Shot to take care of those reduction damage abilities/innates/items and help the team with a debuff.

In terms of items, Choice Band is the best damage booster and Choice Scarf is an option against fast mons. Focus Sash is useful against priority moves.

Consider Fire Gem for flexibility and boosting Flame Charge to provide damage and speed boosts.

You can replace Play Rough or Flame Charge with Flare Blitz for more damage, or Play Rough with Quick Attack for priority.

   .comment = Enter battle, use Audinite to go Mega and get ready to something really simple.

You have 2 main heals (Wish and Soft-Boiled) and a 3rd one that is also an offensive move (Draining Kiss). They all work in different ways so you can stack both for 100% in a single turn or 50%+dmg+some extra heal while you always live dangerously until you reach SpAtk levels high enough, thanks to Calm Mind, to become a real menace.

Mega Audino here is quite tanky and has a good SpAtk base so find a Pokémon that can't kill you (and those exists a lot; Mega Audino can tank a bunch of physical mons while burned and cursed(!)), and heal here and there while you use Calm Mind in the middle of those. Since you can heal for 100% after 2 turns whenever you need, you just need to make sure that you can survive the hit.

    Nature = Adamant
    Moves = Shell Smash, Solar Blade, Earthquake / High Horsepower, Stone Edge
    Comment = Sun is mandatory for this set to work, as otherwise, Torterra is too slow to outspeed the threats it needs to surpass. Stamina is here to make its setup easier against physical attackers and can counteract the defense drop from Shell Smash.

    Sitrus Berry is included to heal Torterra during its setup and take advantage of its innate Big Leaves ability to restore the berry. The EVs are tailored to ensure that Torterra has enough speed to outpace Chlorophyll-boosted threats and enough bulk to execute its setup.

    If Mimikyu, Focus Sash, Sturdy, or Multiscale/Shadow Shield users are a concern, Bullet Seed can replace Solar Blade. If you're playing on Grassy Terrain alongside the sun or in Doubles, High Horsepower is recommended instead of Earthquake.

    Strength is chosen for more accuracy and PP than Stone Edge, but be cautious of defense drops, which can leave you vulnerable to priority moves. Rock Slide is a safer option than Strength and Stone Edge, and it also has a chance to flinch opponents, which is advantageous. However, it's weaker unless you're using Sheer Force, in which case your setup becomes more challenging without Stamina.

    While Rough Skin can inflict chip damage on opponents, Stamina is preferred since it boosts your defense when you take hits. Sheer Force is a viable choice if you have Rock Slide; otherwise, it's not as effective.

    Regarding Berries, while Sitrus is the best option in my opinion, you can experiment with riskier yet more rewarding berries like Salac or Liechi.

    Comment = Watch opposing trainers become bewildered by this formidable wooden wall. Determining the optimal move sequence can be challenging, as it depends on the opposing Pokémon.

With Substitute you'll lose some HP but you'll regain them with Leech Seed in one or two turn using Protect and Grassy Surge. At this point you should be in range of using Curse, this will cost half of your HP. Since Trevenant is pretty slow you'll be able to figure out which move to use so that Trevenant doesn't get knocked out and the stall strategy continues. Once he reaches around 1/4 of his total HP Trevenant will eat his berry gaining a lot of HP (even right after he used Substitute or Curse), but thanks to Harvest among his innates, he will be able to recycle his berry with a 50% chance (100% chance under the sun, which is recommended).

Avenger in combination with Big Leaves and Feline Prowess will ensure a devastating first special move. Leafeon can learn Solar Beam & Giga Drain but you have to transform it into Flareon and Espeon in order to learn Flamethrower and Power Gem for a good coverage against Bug, Steel and Flying Pokémon.

Alternatively, Choice Scarf can be used instead of Choice Specs to increase the Speed even further in exchange of its power.

It's also a very important core to Sun Teams because of Drought, so that Pokémon without Chloroplast that have abilities like Solar Power, Chlorophyll or Harvest can be used to their full potential.

   comment = Seviper puts its massive fangs to use in Elite Redux. It is one of two Pokemon, alongside Steelix, with the combination of Strong Jaw and Coil Up. With Strong Jaw, Crunch becomes a one-turn 120 BP priority STAB move, boosted further by Hyper Aggressive and Dark Gem. Solenoglyphs means Seviper will usually add poison to what it doesn't OHKO. Sucker Punch and Dragon Dance both give Seviper additional Speed control outside of Coil Up. The last slot is customizable based on what team you'll be facing; use it to exploit 4x weaknesses!

Seviper relies heavily on Coil Up, so it needs to weave in and out of battle. Pair it with slow pivots or Eject Button Pokemon to create opportunities to bring it in safely. Seviper uses all of its ability options well. If you have Toxic Spikes or Sticky Web support, Merciless will out-damage Hyper Aggressive. Opportunist provides the least immediate damage, but Seviper can consistently put all but the bulkiest threats in range with the first Coil Up hit, securing a second turn of priority. Seviper can also forsake the Speed EVs for HP as needed, especially on sets with Opportunist.

Watch out for Pokemon with Dazzling or Queenly Majesty. Also be wary of faster priority users, Steel-types that resist Dark like Bisharp, and other Dark/Poison-types, which may require slotting in Earthquake into the moveset.

    nature = relaxed
    moves = wish, teleport, seismic toss, protect
   comment = With Generation 8 Teleport, Chansey makes an incredibly potent pivot. A previous upside to its main competitor, Blissey, was Blissey's ability to use Heavy Duty Boots to avoid getting chipped by Stealth Rocks. Now, due to Regenerator, Chansey has little to fear from entry hazards, resolving one of the major downsides to its use. 
   
   Wish + Teleport are the core moves of the build, allowing Chansey to pass a slow Wish to a weathered teammate, giving it another chance to sweep or maximizing its defensive utility. Seismic Toss makes Chansey slightly less passive against Taunt. Protect allows Chansey to reap the benefits of Wish without taking another attack. 
   
   However, since Chansey has Regenerator and infamously massive bulk and is still passive despite Seismic Toss, there are many other options to replace Protect or Seismic Toss that can be useful depending on its teammates. Stealth Rock allows Chansey's teammates to bypass Focus Sash and Sturdy, Thunder Wave or Toxic can neuter opposing offensive or defensive threats, Heal Bell provides its teammates valuable status removal, Light Screen or Reflect alongside a Wish can provide a teammate an important setup opportunity, and situationally against weather teams, Chansey can even use Sunny Day or Rain Dance to change the weather. 
   
   The final two move slots are highly malleable, and although Seismic Toss and Protect are the default moves given, the user can and should adapt Chansey to their playstyle, team, and opponents to maximize its effectiveness in every battle.

    evs = 252, 252, 4, 0, 0, 0
    nature = Adamant
    moves = Double Edge / Body Press, Dragon Tail, Stealth Rock, Shore Up
    comment = Nigh unbreakable physically, sets rocks and annoys things by phasing them onto said rocks. Tectonize recoil-free double edge hits like a truck and punishes things that want to stay in and defog on him. Alternatively, Fort Knox and Body Press can achieve similar results, though it takes a turn of defog to set up. Replace attack EVs with defense EVs if you choose this option. Shore up keeps him healthy, allowing him to reset Stealth Rock if the opponent removes it.

    evs = 248, 0, 8, 252, 0, 0
    nature = Modest
    moves = Roost, Defog, Hurricane, Volt Switch / Thunder
    comment = Solid rain setter, hazard control, and pivot. Roost keeps him healthy, Heavy Duty Boots protect him from the rocks he wants to remove, Hurricane takes advantage of the rain, and Volt Switch allows him to pivot into a teammate ready to abuse his rain. You could run Thunder over Volt Switch for more power, but this detracts from his utility as a rain setter.

    moves = Spectral Thief, Draco Meteor, Recover, Toxic
    comment = One of the few Mons capable of viably running a mixed set, Twist Dimensions allows it to run a -spe nature, letting it not have to choose between bulk or power. Toxic+Recover lets it serve as a general answer to many things, spectral thief allows it to steal boosts, and Draco Meteor offers immediate power.

    evs = 0, 252, 0, 0, 4, 252
    nature = Jolly
    moves = Thunderous Kick, Bolt Beak, Brave Bird, U-turn
    comment = A decent revenge killer or speed control option, capable of outspeeding all unboosted Pokémon except Deoxys-S. Thunderous Kick provides solid Fighting STAB, Bolt Beak essentially functions as a third STAB, hitting hard due to Zapdos usually moving first, and Brave Bird is present but is generally not the best choice to click. U-turn allows Gapdos to pivot against opponents that don't want to be revenge killed or can threaten it with strong priority.

    nature = Impish
    moves = Powerup Punch, Drain Punch, Mega Punch, Frustration
    comment = Regigigas is an immensely bulky beast, capable of fully investing in bulk while still dealing significant damage due to Juggernaut and Power Core boosting its offense based on its Defense. Power-up Punch and Drain Punch offer incredible utility when combined with Raging Boxer, allowing it to boost its Attack, sustain itself, and hit Steel types it would otherwise struggle against. Frustration hits Ghost-types that otherwise counter it, and Mega Punch serves as its strongest STAB move with Raging Boxer.

    evs = 252, 4, 252, 0, 0, 0
    nature = Impish
    moves = Earthquake, Ice Fang, Rest, Sleep Talk
    comment = With Eviolite and Fur Coat, Piloswine becomes an absolute behemoth on the physical side, capable of walling nearly any physically oriented set it encounters. Earthquake is its strongest STAB, Ice Fang is a secondary STAB that both complements Earthquake well and allows it to set up its mediocre attack stat. Rest serves as it's only form of recovery, with Sleep Talk allowing it to potentially maintain offensive pressure. DAMN BOII HE THICC

  ability = Grass Pelt
  evs = 252, 252, 4, 0, 0, 0
  nature = Brave
  moves = U-turn, Wood Hammer, Nature's Madness, Sucker Punch
  comment = The combination of Grass Pelt and Assault Vest transforms Tapu Bulu into a solid pivot, allowing it to switch in, absorb hits, and then perform a slow U-turn into a teammate. Wood Hammer serves as a strong Grass STAB, further boosted by Tapu Bulu's Grassy Terrain. Nature's Madness can chunk a switch-ins health, and Sucker Punch gives it priority, allowing it to bypass it's slow speed to secure the KO on weakened targets.

Blastoise

    ability = Regenerator
    evs = 252, 0, 0, 252, 4, 0
    nature = Modest
    moves = Rapid Spin, Flip Turn, Water Pulse, Ice Beam
    comment = Access to valuable utility moves in Flip Turn and Rapid Spin, decent natural bulk, and Mega Launcher boosted moves come together to make Blastoise effective at hazard control while also being able to deal decent damage. Water Pulse is its most consistent STAB and Launcher boosted move, although Hydro Pump or Water Spout are alternatives, at the cost of accuracy and consistency, respectively. Ice Beam provides helpful coverage, hitting Grass-types that Blastoise otherwise struggles against. A slow Flip Turn safely brings in allies, and Rapid Spin allows it to remove hazards from its side of the field.

    EVs = 252, 0, 252, 0, 4, 0
    Nature = Impish
    Moves = Roost, Defog, U-turn, Foul Play / Knock Off
    Comment = A solid support Pokémon, capable of setting up Tailwind and removing hazards. Roost helps maintain its health, enabling multiple opportunities to come in and defog. Defog serves its purpose of hazard removal, while U-turn permits switching to a different ally while dealing minor chip damage. Foul Play is effective against physical Pokémon, whereas Knock Off provides additional utility.

    evs = 252, 0, 252, 4, 0, 0 
    nature = Bold
    moves = Roost, Stealth Rock, Scald, Ice Beam
    comment = A very cool Pokémon for setting up rocks. Its unique typing gives it a solid matchup against many Rapid Spin users, and its ability, Competitive, allows it to punish Defog, potentially boosting its Special Attack to extreme levels. It also annoys opponents with Scald burns and has a chance to cause frostbite if you're lucky.

    nature = Adamant/Jolly
    moves = Facade, Crunch, Play Rough, Bulk Up / Fire Fang
    comment = With Guts and Quick Feet, Granbull becomes an incredible wallbreaker that's also decently fast. With an excellent offensive typing and a useful third pseudo STAB in Fighting Spirit, this mon is capable of hitting the majority of Pokémon for neutral STAB damage at the very least.
}
Gardevoir-mega

    evs = 0, 0, 4, 252, 0, 252
    nature = Timid
    moves = Calm Mind, Substitute, Future Sight / Expanding Force, Moonblast / Hyper Voice
    comment = A pretty cool mon, Substitute helps to alleviate its terrible physical bulk by limiting how much damage it takes. Calm Mind allows her to boost both her SpA and SpD, increasing both her damage output and staying power on the special side. Moonblast is her strongest Fairy STAB, although Hyper Voice can be used to bypass opposing substitutes. Future Sight allows her to attack while setting up or help overwhelm walls with multiple attacks per turn, while Expanding Force offers more immediate power.
}
Silvally
{
    name = Demi-God Ekiller
    item = Silk Scarf / Life Orb / Leftovers
    ability = Unaware
    evs = 248, 252, 0, 0, 0, 0 
    nature = Adamant
    moves = Extreme Speed, Frustration / Shadow Claw, Recover, Swords Dance / Parting Shot
    comment = An excellent selection of abilities, as well as access to STAB and Adaptability-boosted Extreme Speed, make Silvally a fantastic revenge killer. It can also function as a decent Unaware wall and pivot with Parting Shot, making this mon ideal for role compression.
}
Mew

    item = Choice Scarf / Leftovers
    ability = Imposter
    evs = 252 HP, 0 Atk, 0 Def, 0 SpA, 0 SpD, 0 Spe/generally irrelevant except for HP
    nature = Irrelevant
    moves = Irrelevant
    comment = With more than double the HP of Ditto, Mew makes a far better abuser of Imposter. Its decent HP stat means it can potentially run Leftovers and make use of fatter mons' own recovery or offensive mons' setup, while a more traditional Choice Scarf allows it to easily revenge kill many boosted or weakened threats.

    evs = 0, 0, 4, 252, 0, 252
    nature = Timid
    moves = Rising Voltage, Volt Switch, Ice Beam, Earth Power
    comment = A strong Rising Voltage abuser, it also has incredible coverage options as an Eeveelution, learning Ice Beam from Glaceon and Earth Power from Leafeon.
}
Vaporeon

    name = Specially Defensive 
    item = Leftovers 
    ability = Regenerator 
    evs = 252, 0, 0, 4, 252, 0 
    nature = Calm
    moves = Scald, Strength Sap, Toxic, Teleport / Ice Beam 
    comment = Vaporeon excels as a special wall due to her solid defensive stats, valuable abilities like Water Veil and Regenerator, and her reliable Water typing. Scald and Strength Sap are preferred to enhance her matchup against physical attackers by reducing their damage output. Toxic handles threats that can't be dealt with using Scald, while Teleport is useful for safely switching in an ally. Ice Beam can also be used to broaden her coverage and potentially Frostbite special targets.
}
Flareon
{
    name = Guts Attacker 
    item = Toxic Orb
    ability = Guts
    evs = 0, 252, 0, 0, 4, 252 
    nature = Adamant 
    moves = Flare Blitz / Blaze Kick, Leaf Blade / Wild Charge, Icicle Crash / Triple Axle, Swords Dance / Extreme Speed
   comment = The very definition of live fast, die hard. Flareon is an absolute monster, blowing as many holes in as many things as it can, before inevitably succumbing to it's toxic orb or recoil damage.
}
Espeon 
{
    name = Big Psychic 
    item = Choice Specs / Life Orb / Choice Scarf 
    ability = Psychic Surge
    evs = 0, 0, 4, 252, 0, 252
    nature = Modest / Timid 
    moves = Expanding Force, Moonblast / Focus Blast, Fire Blast / Flamethrower / Overheat, Volt Switch 
    comment = Similar to its cousin Jolteon, Espeon benefits from setting its own terrain for a terrain-boosted move. Being an Eeveelution grants it an extensive pool of coverage options. Its naturally high speed and ability to set Psychic Terrain make it excellent for speed and priority control, outpacing all unboosted Pokémon and suppressing priority moves. This synergy also complements its Avenger ability, allowing it to function as a potent revenge killer. Alternatively, Choice Specs or a Life Orb can significantly bolster Espeon's power, turning it into a formidable wallbreaker.
}
Umbreon 
{
    name = No Taunt Pls
    item = Leftovers 
    ability = Soul Linker
    evs = 252, 0, 252, 0, 4, 0 
    nature = Bold
    moves = Strength Sap / Wish / Moonlight, Toxic / Leech Seed, Taunt, Teleport 
   comment = Thanks to a very funny ability in Soul Linker, Umbreon essentially turns the opponents damage against them, which works well with it thanks to excellent bulk. Teleport and Taunt are mandatory, allowing Umbreon to function as both an interesting pivot and deny opponents attempts to wear it down through passive damage, or overwhelm it with boosts. The third slot should be some form of reliable recovery, as the vast majority of the damage this set inflicts mandates also receiving said damage. Strength Sap is useful to make the damage output of strong physical threats more manageable, Wish allows it to support teammates and synergizes extremely well with Teleport, while Moonlight serves as a more generally reliable and immediate option. The last slot should go to either Leech Seed or Toxic, with the former improving longevity and the latter ensuring most targets faint even if they avoid hitting Umbreon.
}
Glaceon 
{
    name = Calm Mind Sweeper 
    item = Life Orb / Shell Bell / Heavy Duty Boots
    ability = Ice Scales
    evs = 252, 0, 252, 4, 0, 0 
    nature = Bold
    moves = Calm Mind, Freeze Dry / Blizzard / Hyper Voice, Earth Power, Thunderbolt 
   comment = Excellent natural bulk combined with Ice Scales makes Glaceon extremely durable, easing it's setup with Calm Mind. Maximum defense investment is preferred, as several Calm Mind boosts alleviate the lack of SpA EVs
}
Sylveon
{
    name = Calm Mind Sweeper 
    item = Life Orb / Shell Bell
    ability = Fairy Aura 
    evs = 252, 0, 252, 4, 0, 0
    nature = Bold
    moves = Hyper Voice / Moonblast, Earth Power, Calm Mind, Wish / Draining Kiss / Fireblast / Agility 
   comment = Sylveon makes an excellent calm mind abuser thanks to her fantastic mono fairy typing, allowing her to run Earth Power to cover the majority of fairy resistant types, therefore freeing her moveslots up for other options such as Wish or Draining Kiss for recovery, Fire blast for the occasional oddball pokemon that resists both Fairy and Ground type, or Agility to fix her lacking speed stat 
}
Diancie-mega
{
    name = Calm Mind Sweeper 
    item = Diancite
    ability = Magic Guard 
    evs = 0, 0, 4, 252, 0, 252
    nature = Timid
    moves = Diamond Storm, Body Press, Moonblast / Draining Kiss, Calm Mind
   comment = Solid mixed defenses, sky high SpA, and an incredible signature move in Diamond Storm enable Diance-mega to become a powerful, bulky, and surprisingly fast sweeper. Diamond Storm has incredible synergy with Body Press, enabling her to bypass special walls that could otherwise slow her down. Calm Mind boosts her already impressive stats to monstrous levels, allowing her to tear through unprepared teams. Lastly, Moonblast or Draining Kiss provide a Fairy STAB, with the former being stronger and the latter increasing longevity.
}
Buzzwole
{
    name = BUZZ! BUZZ! BUZZ!
    item = Life Orb / Shell Bell / Leftovers 
    ability = Sheer Force 
    evs = 152, 252, 0, 0, 0, 104
    nature = Adamant 
    moves = Quiver Dance, Bulk Up, Brick Break / Close Combat, Leech Life / Fell Stinger / Poison Jab / Meteor Mash
   comment = Another Bug to be graced with the much coveted Quiver Dance, and an interesting pick for sure. 104 Speed EVs allow him to outspeed Timid base 100s at +1, while the rest goes into Attack and HP to maximize his damage output and survivability.
   Quiver Dance does wonders for him, helping to patch up his severely lacking SpD and Spe stats. Bulk Up serves as secondary set up, allowing him to further bolster his already impressive physical side. With Sheer Force and Iron Fist, Brick Break reaches an impressive base power, without having to sacrifice the bulk he dances so hard to maintain. Alternatively, Close Combat offers a significantly stronger alternative if you are willing to suffer the defense drops. For the last slot, Bug STAB is an option, however this leave Buzz quite walled by most Fairy types, so Meteor Mash or Poison Jab could provide useful coverage against them.
}
Goodra
{
    name = Bulky Curse Sweeper 
    item = Toxic Orb
    ability = Sap Sipper
    evs = 248, 252, 8, 0, 0, 0
    nature = Adamant 
    moves = Curse, Facade, Dragon Tail, Poison Tail / Power Whip / Fire Punch
   comment = With access to a phenomenal combination of abilities in Poison Heal, Hydrate, and Amphibious, Goodra is able to find itself a unique niche as a Water type Facade abuser. It's excellent special bulk compliments a Curse set well, and after a few boosts it becomes a formidable powerhouse, both eating and delivering large amounts of damage.
Facade serves as the main source of damage, with Poison Tail both providing coverage against Faeries that might try to threaten it, and potentially poisoning as well, allowing for passive damage as it boosts. Dragon Tail serves as a secondary STAB, and can be used to phase out opponents who attempt to boost up alongside Goodra. Alternatively, Power Whip or Fire Punch are options to hit oddball targets that might otherwise slow Goodra down, such as Quagsire or Ferrothorn.
}
Articuno
{
    name = North Wind Support 
    item = Heavy Duty Boots
    ability = North Wind
    evs = 248, 0, 0, 4, 252, 0
    nature = Calm
    moves = Roost, Defog, U-Turn, Ice Beam
   comment = With access to potentially the single best support ability in North Wind and a pivoting move in U-Turn, Articuno functions as excellent support, greatly reducing the damage it's team takes by setting Aurora Veil and removing hazards. Take care not to be reckless and allow it's Heavy Duty Boots to be removed, as it's poor defensive typing gives it an extreme vulnerability to Stealth Rock, greatly nullifying it's value as a defensive pivot.
}
Bastiodon
{
    name = Bastion 
    item = Leftovers / Life Orb
    ability = Stamina 
    evs = 248, 0, 8, 0, 248, 0
    nature = Calm
    moves = Stealth Rock, Shore Up, Body Press, Iron Defense / Toxic / Roar
   comment = A fantastic combination of abilities as well as ridiculous natural bulk makes Bastiodon quite hard to break on either side. Besides Stealth Rock and Recovery, Body Press synergizes well with Dauntless Shield and Stamina. For the last move, Iron Defense serves well to boost it's defense to astronomical levels in a single turn, making it's Body Press akin to a force of nature. Toxic is a decent alternative, useful for occasions where you want to keep hazards up against something spamming defog. Finally, Roar could be used, phasing moves naturally having good synergy with hazards and it allows Bastiodon to punish Ghost or Psychic types that might seek to boost up and overwhelm him.
}
Milotic 
{
    name = Mixed Wall
    item = Flame Orb
    ability = Marvel Scale 
    evs = 248, 0, 252, 8, 0, 0 
    nature = Bold
    moves = Recover, Haze, Scald, Moonblast 
   comment = A solid defensive typing, good natural bulk, and an excellent selection of abilities combine to turn Milotic into a durable wall on both sides. Haze+Recover allow it to serve as a general answer to many forms of set up, while Adaptability boosted Scald and Moonblast serve as both damage output, and a means to further bolster her bulk via Scald burns and Moonblast SpA drops.
}
Tyranitar-mega
{
    name = DDance Sweeper 
    item = Tyranitarite
    ability =  Moxie / Sand Stream
    evs = 88, 252, 0, 0, 0, 168 
    nature = Adamant 
    moves = Dragon Dance, Wicked Blow, Strength, High Horsepower
   comment = Tyranitar has been blessed with a myriad of boons, from a nuclear new Dark STAB in Wicked Blow to a more consistent(and stronger thanks to Juggernaut) Rock STAB in Strength, to slightly stronger Ground coverage thanks to Juggernaut additionally boosting High Horsepower. 168 Speed EVs outspeed Timid base 100s after a Dragon Dance, with the rest going into Attack and HP to maximize it's damage and bulk.
}
Blacephalon
{
    name = Special Scarf 
    item = Choice Scarf 
    ability = Pyromancy 
    evs = 0, 0, 4, 252, 0, 252 
    nature = Timid
    moves = Shadow Ball, Fire Blast, Mind Blown / Hidden Power(Fighting), Trick 
   comment = A good Speed tier and naturally high SpA make Blacephalon a good Choice Scarf user, outspeeding all unboosted mons and many Swift Swimmers and the like. Fire Blast serves as a strong Fire STAB, with Shadow Ball doing the same for Ghost. Mind Blown is an extremely powerful attack at the cost of cutting it's own Health, while HP Fighting hits oddball targets like Gyarados-mega or Tyranitar who resist it's STAB combination. Finally, Trick can be used to cripple opposing walls or lock offensive mons into their set up moves.
}
Heatmor
{
    name = AV Attacker
    item = Assault Vest 
    ability = Steelworker
    evs = 252, 252, 4, 0, 0, 0 
    nature = Adamant 
    moves = Fire Lash, Bullet Punch, Meteor Mash / Drain Punch, Stomping Tantrum 
   comment = A nice buff to it's bulk alongside it's already existing signature move Fire Lash(which has a 100% chance to lower the opponents defense) enable Heatmor as a viable AV abuser. Bullet Punch boosted by Tough Claws and Steelworker becomes a powerful priority move, Meteor Mash gives Heatmor the chance to boost it's attack, further increasing it's damage output alongside Fire Lash. Drain Punch could be used here instead to provide sustain, which this set notably lacks. Stomping Tantrum fills the last slot, having both good synergy with potential Meteor Mash misses, and allows Heatmor to hit fire types it would otherwise struggle against.
}
Yveltal 
{
    name = God of Death
    item = Life Orb / Shell Bell / Heavy Duty Boots
    ability = Bad Luck 
    evs = 180, 0, 0, 252, 0, 76
    nature = Modest
    moves = Nasty Plot, Taunt / Roost, Dark Pulse, Oblivion Wing / Hurricane 
   comment = Being granted access to an actually useful boosting move in addition to a plethora of fantastic abilities has made it amply clear that this mon is indeed a force of nature.
   76 EVs in Speed guarantee Yveltal is the fastest unboosted mon in the game with Air Blower active, but investing fully into Speed to outspeed boosted foes is an option as well. The rest should go into SpA, and then HP whatever you choose. Nasty Plot boosts it's already impressive SpA to nuclear levels, allowing it to shred through all save the most durable or resistant walls. Dark Pulse is a consistent STAB move, with the added benefit of potentially denying a slower opponent a move via flinch. Oblivion Wing serves as an excellent secondary STAB, and can also provide valuable sustain to variants that opt for Taunt over Roost. Hurricane is an option instead, providing higher power at the cost of accuracy and a less useful/consistent secondary effect. Taunt or Roost are the main options for the last slot, with Taunt allowing it to deny hazards or recovery and Roost providing valuable sustain in addition to removing it's Flying type for the turn, allowing it to avoid SE damage from attacks aimed at that side of it's typing.
}
Xerneas
{
    name = DEER
    item = Power Herb
    ability = Pixilate 
    evs = 0, 0, 4, 252, 0, 252 
    nature = Modest / Timid 
    moves = Geomancy, Boomburst, Earth Power, Ingrain / Substitute 
   comment = Somehow, the Deer of Life has become more terrifying than it's death and destruction inspired brother, Pixilate and Fairy Aura boosted Boomburst render all things to dust, and Earth Power provides perfect coverage, hitting Fire, Poison, and Steel types that might aim to survive more than a single Boomburst on account of their typing. Geomancy is it's signature move, and with Power Herb it becomes a single turn boosting moves that even Quiver Dancers drool over. For the last slot, Ingrain is an option to prevent opponents from phasing Xerneas out, preventing them from wasting it's Power Herb. Substitute is an option instead, allowing it to scout out how the opponent reacts, therefore allowing to to preserve it's Herb if strong counterplay that could prevent it's sweep is present.

    moves = Flip Turn, Freeze Dry, Slack Off, Toxic / Encore / Heal Bell / Scald
   comment = Thanks to a couple....minor... buffs, Dewgong manages to find use on many teams, providing valuable support with it's extremely useful ability in North Wind. It also functions as an excellent wall, becoming nigh invincible on whichever side it chooses to supplement with it's ability. Freeze Dry serves as the main source of damage, with Ice being an excellent offensive type and Freeze Dry specifically being able to hit opposing Water Types for SE damage. Flip Turn allows The Gong to pivot out of bad matchups, allowing it to safely bring in an ally. Slack Off provides sustain, as even only taking 3% from most attacks does tend to add up. The last slot is generally free, and allows it to customize to suit it's team, having such options as Scald or Toxic to further spread status among the opposing team, Heal Bell enables it to further support it's allies, and Encore allowing it to further frustrate opponents by  locking them into their status or weak attacking moves.

    evs = 252, 0, 4, 252, 0, 0(0 spe IVs)
    nature = Quiet
    moves = Nasty Plot, Recover, Shadow Ball, Tri Attack
   comment = Decent natural bulk combined with Eviolite makes Porygon2 quite sturdy for a sweeper, allowing it to set up multiple Nasty Plot boosts to patch up it's somewhat lacking SpA stat. Tri Attack is P2s' strongest Normal STAB that doesn't have any drawbacks, with the added benefit of potentially inflicting a status upon the opponent as well. Shadow Ball is it's best option hit ghosts with. A Quiet nature and 0 Speed IVs allow Porygon to go last as often as possible, therefore activating Analytic and maximizing it's damage output.

    nature = Adamant 
    moves = Swords Dance, Fury Attack, Pin Missile / U-Turn / X-Scissor, Sacred Sword 
   comment = Thanks to decent bulk with Eviolite and Perfectionist allowing him to gain priority on low BP moves, Scyther becomes a fast and durable sweeper, at the notable downside of being inconsistent due to the mechanics behind multi-hit moves.
   Fury Attack serves as the main damage output, gaining a Flying typing thanks to Aerilate while also gaining priority thanks to Perfectionist. Pin Missile can serve as a secondary STAB, although U-Turn provides valuable utility in a pivoting option and X-Scissor allows it to hit things immune to priority with STAB. Sacred Sword serves as the last attacking move, allowing Scyther to hit Steel types it's dual STAB is otherwise resisted by. Swords Dance fills the last move slot, allowing Scyther to boost it's attack and tear through teams.

    nature = Adamant 
    moves = Dragon Dance, Photon Geyser, Strength / Stone Edge, Frustration / Sunsteel Strike / Outrage / Earthquake 
   comment = Thanks to the lack of Z moves and the subsequent rework of Ultra Burst into a move based Mega, NDM finds himself in the unique position of being able to combine two powerful sets, with his good bulk and Prism Armor in Dusk Mane form usually allowing him to proc his Weakness Policy, then Mega Evolve if needed to surprise threats with a drastic shift in Speed as well as a modest bump to power.
   Photon Geyser serves as the STAB for this set, as well as being mandatory to allow it to Ultra Burst. Dragon Dance is the next hard slot, allowing it to boost it's Speed and Attack, further increasing it's destructive power. The last two slots should be dedicated to coverage, as Psychic is quite a poor type and there are many threats that might aim to eat such an attack. 
   252 Attack EVs maximize Necrozmas sweeping potential, with 60 Speed EVs allowing it to outspeed pokemon with 90 base speed or below after a single Dragon Dance, without having to rely on Ultra Burst right away. The rest go into HP, to maximize it's bulk and allow it to activate it's Weakness Policy against as many threats as possible.

    nature = Impish 
    moves = Strength, Infestation, Toxic, Pain Split / Encore 
   comment = With Contrary Strength, Shuckle gains the ability to boost both it's defenses while also delivering (extremely weak) attacks. This allows it to build into an extremely durable wall despite it's low HP stat, with it's skyhigh base defenses quickly rising to extremely high levels. Infestation and Toxic serve as passive damage, as this set is severely lacking in damage output. The last slot should go to pain split to maximize longevity and lessen Shuckle's Leftover dependency, or Encore to frustrate enemies who attempt to take advantage of Shuckle through status, boosting, etc.

    nature = Impish 
    moves = Spirit Break, Taunt, Light Screen, Reflect 
   comment = Thanks to a plethora of useful defensive abilities, Grimmsnarl becomes even more suited to it's vanilla niche as a screen setter. Light Screen and Reflect reduce all damage taken from their respective stat. Taunt allows it to deny the opponent hazards, status, or boosting. Spirit Break serves as a useful final move, as Fairy type has no immunities and the SpA drop further serves to reduce the damage it and it's team takes.

    nature = Careful 
    moves = Slack Off, Curse, Body Slam / Return, Body Press / Darkest Lariat
   comment = A classic Snorlax set, enhanced thanks to his gains in reliable recovery and status immunity allowing him to function as an even better Curse user than before. Curse+Slack off allow him to setup on many things, with his high HP and SpD combining with Curse boosts to make him extremely durable while also packing quite the punch. Body Slam is a decently powerful Normal STAB with a useful secondary effect, although Return is an option for slightly more power. For the last slot, either Body Press or Darkest Lariat serve to allow it to muscle past Steel and Ghost types, respectively.

    nature = Bold
    moves = Nuzzle, Super Fang, U-Turn / Volt Switch, Thunderbolt  / Thunder 
   comment = Thanks to a myriad of useful tools such as Nuzzle allowing it to spread status, Volt Switch or U-Turn to pivot, and Super Fang to instantly chunk a targets health, Pachirisu functions as a good defensive pivot, capable of stomaching a surprising number of hits thanks to Fur Coat and good special bulk.

    nature = Impish
    moves = Spikes / Stealth Rock, Whirlwind / Stealth Rock / Spikes,  Roost, Steel Wing / Wing Attack / Brave Bird
   comment = An incredible typing and physical defense make Skarmory a fantastic wall, setting hazards while also wearing most physical threats down through chip damage thanks to it's Rocky Helmet. Any combination of Hazards and Whirlwind will do, while Roost is mandatory to keep Skarmory healthy and stacking hazards. The last slot should ideally go to some sort of attack to not leave Skarmory completely helpless against Taunt, although you could instead opt for dual hazards+Whirlwind if you're not worried about that.

    nature = Adamant 
    moves = Curse, Substitute, Extreme Speed, Frustration 
   comment = Being a baby pokemon, Eevee is often far from the most viable or ideal choice. However, he does have the added benefit of offering an extreme amount of cuteness to teams, which can often be difficult to fit.

    evs = 252, 0, 252, 0, 4, 0
    nature = Impish / Bold 
    moves = Imprison, Transform, Block, U-Turn
   comment = Hi there. Are you evil? Do you enjoy inflicting pain and misery upon whatever victim might be in front of you? Then look no further, as Mew apparently enjoys these things as well. Due to it's absurdly wide movepool, Mew finds itself with access to a terrifying combo. Block prevents the opposing Pokemon from switching out, while Imprison+Transform enables Mew to render the opposing Pokemon completely incapable of performing any action save struggling, allowing Mew to both easily remove it from the game, while additionally abusing whatever tools said Pokemon had to the greatest extent, allowing it to easily torment defensive pokemon through stacking their own hazards agains them, or offensive ones by setting itself up for a sweep.

    moves = Explosion, Stone Edge, Fissure, U-Turn
   comment = This set is incredibly simple and straightforward. Explode if you want whats in front of you dead, U-Turn otherwise. Thanks to Aerilate, Choice Band, and an incredible Attack, Explosion will do a massive amount of damage to nearly any target, resulting in a large hole in most things irregardless of the opponent attempting counterplay.

    item = Heavy-Duty Boots

    nature = Calm 
    moves = Rapid Spin, Spikes / Stealth Rock, Wil-o-wisp, Flare Blitz / Fire Punch 
   comment = Thanks to a rare combination in Galvanize and Rapid Spin, Coalossal finds itself in the unique position to not be spinblocked by ghosts, allowing it to function as extremely consistent hazard removal via bypassing the typical tools used to deny Rapid Spin. Giving it a move such as Spikes or Stealth Rock allows it to set it's own hazards, allowing for valuable role compression. Wil-o-wisp allows it to cripple opposing physical attackers, greatly reducing their damage output. Finally, some sort of attacking move should be run in the last slot to prevent coalossal from being excessively passive. Generally Fire is more advisable, as it threatens many Hazard setters far more than a Rock type move would, further allowing Coalossal to excel at it's role in hazard control 
}
Aggron-mega
{
    name = Curse Sweeper 
    item = Aggronite
    ability = Juggernaut 
    evs = 248, 8, 252, 0, 0, 0
    nature = Careful 
    moves = Curse, Slack Off, Heavy Slam / Iron Head, Body Press / Earthquake 
   comment = An absurdly high Defense, mono Steel typing combined with Primal Armor, and access to reliable recovery all combine to turn Mega Aggron into a nigh unbreakable beast on the physical side, with Curse enabling it to become an even more unstoppable force. Curse functions as a boost to both Aggrons' Attack and Defense, at the generally negligible cost of lowering it's already low speed. Slack off keeps Aggron healthy, preventing it from being worn down and allowing it to easily boost it's stats to maximum against many physical threats. Heavy Slam is a reliable Steel type STAB that often reaches good base power thanks to Aggrons weight, although Iron Head could be run as a more consistent option instead. For the last slot, Body Press synergizes well with Curse, Juggernaut, and Aggron as a whole allowing him to hit opposing Steel Types for SE damage. Earthquake can provide to the same ends, but lacks the high amount of synergy Body Press offers, in return offering a situationally more powerful attack, with the added benefit of not making contact.

    evs = 252, 252, 0, 0, 4, 0
    nature = Adamant 
    moves = Extreme Speed, Bullet Punch, Sacred Sword / Roost, Swords Dance
   comment = Incredible Attack, excellent typing, and a ridiculous combination of abilities combine to turn Scizor-mega into one of the most threatening offensive pokemon in the entire game, capable of tearing through teams lacking strong counterplay with ease thanks to it's powerful priority moves in Extreme Speed and Bullet Punch. Sacred Sword is an option to allow it to muscle past certain Steel types, while Roost allows it to take full advantage of it's bulk and typing, allowing it to freely set up multiple Swords Dances if needed.
}
Furret 
{
    name = Subbell
    item = Shell Bell / Salac Berry (Belly Drum)
    ability = Adaptability 
    evs = 0, 252, 0, 0, 4, 252
    nature = Adamant 
    moves = Belly Drum / Coil, Substitute, Body Slam / Return / Headbutt, Drain Punch / Focus Punch / Fire Punch
   comment = Good Speed and an excellent ability combination in Adaptability+Scrappy enable Furret to skip Ghost coverage, enabling it to setup behind a Substitute, ignoring most direct attempts at inflicting it with status as well as limiting the damage it takes. Belly Drum synergizes well with Substitute, as using it after Sub will put Furret at exactly the right HP to activate Salac Berry, turning it into a fast and devestatingly strong sweeper. Alternatively, Coil takes much longer to set up, but pairs well with Shell Bell and Substitute thanks to increasing Defense alongside Attack. Normal STAB fills the next slot, which a choice few moves offering acceptable BP with useful secondary effects. For the last slot, Steel and Rock coverage such as Drain Punch, or Focus Punch with skillful Sub usage is an obvious, although Fire Punch is an option to hit more specific targets harder. 
}
Chimecho
{
    name = Calm Mind Sweeper 
    item = Leftovers / Life Orb
    ability = Mystic Power / Magic Guard 
    evs = 248, 0, 252, 8, 0, 0
    nature = Bold
    moves = Calm Mind, Recover, Stored Power / Moonblast, Boomburst / Shadow Ball / Energy Ball
   comment = A unique and useful typing complimented by workable bulk enables Chimecho as a strong Calm Mind sweeper, with access to Recover easing it's setup and allowing it to boost itself to +6 easily. Furthermore, it is graced with the choice of two excellent ability options, with Magic Guard allowing it to wield a Life Orb for free, ignore passive damage, and potentially function as an excellent Burn absorber if needed.

   Mystic Power is an equally appealing alternative, STAB offering a substantial increase in power over a Life Orb, while not giving up it's item slot, allowing it to potentially use Leftovers and lessen it's reliance on Recover, allowing it to setup faster.

    evs = 252, 252, 0, 0, 4, 0 
    nature = Adamant 
    moves = Flip Turn, First Impression, Leech Life / X-Scissor, Knock Off
   comment = Excellent bulk further complemented by good abilities, Attack, and movepool options enable Golisopod as a solid Assault Vest user, with options such as Flip Turn to bring allies in safely, one of the most powerful priority moves in First Impression, Leech Life for sustain, and Knock Off for utility. X-Scissor is also an option over Leech Life, offering higher damage and excellent potential for Crits with Hyper Cutter.

   Golisopod also has several other viable movepool options such as Close Combat, Poison Jab, or Shadow Claw should you wish to hit a specific target harder.

    nature = Jolly
    moves = Giga Impact, Zen Headbutt, Rock Slide, High Horsepower / Earthquake
   comment = This absolute beast can destroy almost everything unresisted or that's not physical wall with Hyper Aggressive Giga Impact. Scrappy makes Giga Impact completely free against Ghost Types. Zen Headbutt, Rock Slide and High Horsepower or Earthquake (depending on the situation) for useful coverage.

    moves = Swords Dance, Triple Axel, Wicked Blow / Knock Off, Ice Shard
   comment = Weavile is one of the best offensive sweepers in the game. After 1 Swords Dance, anything not named steelix, aggron, and sometimes camerupt will most likely die in 1 hit.

    evs = 252, 0, 4, 252, 0, 0
    nature = Modest
    moves = Scald, Moonblast, Flip Turn, Recover
   comment = Utterly destroys stuff if it gets the Competitive Boost. You can use it to punish Defog, Intimidate/Scare (to a lesser extent), or Sticky Webs (including getting it Magic Bounced to you). Flip Turn is there when they switch into a Special Wall (Mainly just Chansey) so you can Flip Turn out, deal decent damage and heal a bit with Shell Bell. You can run Quiet if you want the extra power when facing against Blissey but Modest allows you to outspeed the not super slow walls (ie. Umbreon). Scald instead of Surf or Hydro Pump so you can fish for burns and the less power doesn't matter much if you have +2 with the added power of Adaptability but Moonblast is your main STAB.

    nature = Adamant/Jolly
    moves = Giga Impact, Extreme Speed, Earthquake, Outrage / Fire Punch
   comment = Thanks to the incredible combination of Rampage and Aerilate, Dragonite becomes a potent wallbreaker capable of quickly and easily crushing almost any Pokemon slower than it in a single turn with Giga Impact. Extreme Speed also serves as a shockingly powerful attack to revenge kill anything faster than Dragonite. Earthquake and Fire Punch are chosen for coverage against the various Pokemon that resist Dragonite's flying STAB.

    nature = Modest
    moves = Hidden Power Fire / Sludge Bomb, Energy Ball, Dragon Pulse, Quiver Dance
   comment = Great Quiver Dance sweeper when you really need a Grass Dragon type. Focus Sash almost guarantees you at least 1 Quiver Dance, 2 or more if the opponent makes a defensive switch (only applicable in Showdown). Regenerator actually allows you to still get value out of the sash even if you take a resisted hit which allows you to still use it's typing defensively. Aerodynamics can also catch Aerilate E-Speed Dragonites and the like off guard allowing you to set up for free while also allowing you free switch ins. Replace HP Fire with Sludge Bomb when (if) it gets it if you need more power to get kills on Forretress and the like.

   comment =  Walls most physical pokemon while ramping up with super power. Incredible in conjunction with Tailwind support.  Near perfect accuracy hypnosis gives you even more opportunity to setup or deal with annoying stuff before you ramp up. +2 sucker punches also deal huge damage. Tailor the EV spread however you need to fit into your team.  Extremely powerful pokemon.

    evs = 0, 252, 0, 4, 0, 252
    nature = Lonely
    moves = Shell Smash, Close Combat, Clanging Scales, Poison Jab
   comment = An absolutely horrifying sweeper thanks to it’s extreme ease in setting up afforded by its great natural bulk combined with multiple defensively oriented innates that even allow for a setup opportunity vs many special attacking Flying or Ice-type Pokemon. Kommo-o is very unfortunately unable to learn Dragon Rush, and as a result Clanging Scales is it’s preferred Dragon STAB due to both it’s slightly higher power even through the EV difference, and it’s ability to not be stonewalled by the numerous Fur Coat Pokemon. Generally, Kommo-o prefers to be in a position where it can steamroll by just clicking +2 Close Combat a bunch of times, as this is by far it’s strongest move. Poison Jab is the most optimal anti-Fairy coverage, as only Mismagius takes more damage from Iron Head, the rest are either equivalent or weaker to Poison Jab.

    moves = Flip Turn, Recover, Toxic, Encore
   comment = Goes in on most set up mons (excluding Raikou if Ground Shock isn't nerfed), clicks Encore, and gives a safe switch in to your big threat via Flip Turn. Toxic is there for any annoying walls you wanna chip (ie: Suicune) and Recover is for extra recover when Water Veil Leftovers with Regenerator isn't enough.

    nature = Jolly
    moves = Plasma Fists, Close Combat / Drain Punch, Ice Punch, Wild Charge
   comment = With Power Fists, Electivire's punching moves hit the target's Special Defense. However, the rest of its physical movepool still hits enemies in their normal Defense stat, meaning that this has the niche of being able to hit either Defense or Special Defense hard while only needing to invest in one offensive stat. The choice between Close Combat and Drain Punch depends on whether you want raw breaking power or a bit of sustain to offset the recoil from Life Orb and Wild Charge. Ice Punch is almost certainly Electivire's best coverage option, but you could theoretically replace it with another punching move, or even another physical move if you want to lean into the 'mixed' nature of the set.

    item = Iapapa Berry
    ability = Regenerator
    evs = 0, 0, 252, 4, 252, 0
    nature = Bold / Calm
    moves = Infestation, Pain Split, Toxic / Sticky Web, Stealth Rock / Sticky Web / Protect
    comment = Shuckle is a serviceable choice for wearing down tanks and walls at low risk. Also, clicking Rocks and Webs.
    Infestation stops it from being Taunt bait (rare as it is) and adds damage over time. Pain Split needs little explanation, click when your HP is low (usually) and your opponent's is high. Some mix of the four moves in the last two slots will tend to get the most mileage out of your bug. The combination of Toxic, Infestation, and Pain Split can burn through the PP of foe's recovery moves, but dual hazards may be situationally preferable. Stealth Rock does what it's done since 2006, Sticky Web suits aggressive teams, and Protect is great for doubles and racking up your damage over time ticks.
    Adjust your nature as appropriate. Zero HP EVs maximize Pain Split's effectiveness, but compromise Shuckle's full bulk. Against anything that hits harder, moving some EVs to HP and focusing on one side of defense can help it stay competitive.
    Regenerator provides a safety net and much needed utility as a pivot, but rolling the dice for defense boosts with Moody might be funny.
    Your item slot has a lot of flexibility. The 50% healing berries, Sitrus Berry or Leftovers will let Shuckle click moves other than Pain Split more often, the choice is mostly up to preference and/or what you're fighting. Mental Herb is cute if you use Shuckle against something with Taunt or Encore. Lum Berry is there if random para or sleep will ruin your day. There's probably something funny you can pull on the AI with a Red Card. That being said, it's still ultimately best as a suicide lead, so Custap Berry, the weakness berries or Focus Sash are there if that's your thing.

Fairy/Ghost mixed with Psychic give you near perfect coverage, so the 4th slot can really be whatever super.effective move you might need. This set should primarily be used on a Doubles team with a Trick Room setter like Reuniclus or Haterrene as it allows you to move first and kill most things before they get a chance to move as you get to click double expanding force.

   Be careful of Rocky Helmet/Rough Skin, Dazzling/Queenly Majesty, and chip from weather or abilities like Aftermath. There is a lot of inconsistency with this kind of set, but when positioned properly with Stealth Rock to deal with Focus Sash and a way to keep Gallade safe from chip, the power of it is unmatched.

    moves = Hypnosis, Shadow Ball, Dream Eater, Dazzling Gleam/Ice Beam
    comment = Sigilyph is an underrated Pokémon but in the right conditions it could do massive damages and sweep the foe's team. 

    Dreamcatcher is an ability that doubles move power if anyone in the field is asleep.
    Its base speed is really good (97) and investing 252 EV on this stat should ensure you the first move. 
    Obviously you'll use Hypnosis as first move and restore your HP with Dream Eater + Shell Bell in case you've missed the first status move or the foe is faster that Sigilyph. 
    Shadow Ball is a must pick thanks to Sigilyph's ability it gains STAB and as fourth move it could be good Dazzling Gleam in case you're facing a Dark type Pokémon but elemental moves like Heat Wave and Ice Beam should work too. 
    It can learn Solar Beam too so it's totally worth even in a Sunny Day/Drought team. 
    Show Sigilyph some love, it deserve it!

    moves = Solar Beam, Belch, Synthesis, Weather Ball
   comment = Get sun up (Ninetales is probably Victreebel's best partner, as it negates priority moves like Ice Shard/Sucker Punch/ESpeed that would otherwise punch through its 65/70 defenses, and you can bait fire moves with Flash Fire) and click Belch to boost your Sp. Atk with Harvest Petaya Berry. With Corrosive, Victreebel hits Steels super-effectively, with Weather Ball being your best move to hit opposing Poison types. Use Synthesis to heal on a switch or after switching in yourself on a resisted hit.

   You could, theoretically, use Starf instead of Petaya to try and fish for a useful +2 boost and run Natural Gift instead of Weather Ball, which with Starf has the distinction of turning into Victreebel's only Psychic move, but a) Natural Gift is physical, necessitating split EV investment and a Mild nature or something, and b) Unless you get lucky, a random +2 boost is going to be less valuable than a definite +1 Sp.

   Excalibur will punish the dragons and fairies that woudl otherwise bother Gallade.

Priority Shadow Sneak and Opportunist allows you to offset Parasects awful speed stat. Phantom adding the Ghost type gives immunity to normal Quick Attack and Extreme Speed.

The combination of Water Veil and Leftovers should help you set up Stockpiles, as well as ensure a fire type will have a hard time breaking through your defenses and you can punish special attackers hard with Mirror Coat.

Steel Wing is Boosted and is there for Rock and Ice coverage. You can Pivot to a better matchup with U-turn if needed and you are free to choose between STAB Return / Double Edge or Frustration to take care of Ghost types.

Hyper Voice offers some hard hitting Neutral STAB, Heat Wave is a Boosted coverage move and the last slot can be pretty flexible. Focus Blast hits hard and covers the Rock Weakness but isn't a Guaranteed Hit while Ominous Wind and Twister are both Giant Wing Boosted for decent damage and coverage as well as the possibility of an Omni Boost or Flinch.

   comment = Like most Guts Facade users this move set is pretty basic but can put in a large amount of work especially with the rats unique addition of Growing Tooth and Looter. Being able to snag a K.O. with a bite move over Facade will grant you a +1 to your ATK stat and Looter will help with longevity as you get worn down from Burn damage. You can use Protect to set up your burn or try to keep Raticate in the back to snag a K.O. and become a wrecking ball. There is some freedom to the biting moves in the moveset to help cover your bases but Ice Fang hits more for super effective than the others and you could also opt for Sucker Punch over Crunch for some Priority.

Slack Off allows it to remain healthy throughout the course of a match so it can reset Stealth Rock, however Toxic is an alternative if youre not worried about needing to keep him alive forever. Body Press is an excellent move alongside Stamina, with every hit he takes increasingly it's power. Strength is a valid alternative, allowing Mudsdale to hit Flying types that it will struggle against otherwise. Finally, High Horsepower serves as a solid Ground STAB option, with Mudsdales Striker ability boosting it to a respectable 123 BP. Alternatively, Earthquake could be run here to avoid any potential accuracy issues. If opting for Earthquake over High Horsepower, switch ability Striker with Own Tempo

Secret Sword is an excellent Fighting STAB, both receiving a Keen Edge boost and allowing it to smash through common Special walls by targeting their weaker Defense stat. Scald is the secondary STAB of choice, offering valuable utility though Burns in addition to having acceptable BP. Calm Mind does what Calm Mind typically does, turning Keldeo into a powerful threat capable of destroying teams. The last slot should go to Taunt or Substitute to avoid things such as Toxic ending it's sweep early, the opponent attempting to set hazards, etc. Alternatively, it has several viable picks for coverage such as Air Slash or Aurora Beam, as well as even an option in priority via Aqua Jet.

Megahorn serves as an extremely powerful nuke, even hitting many things that resist it extremely hard. Cross Poison is a secondary stab with the added bonus of a poison chance, giving Beedrill some slight potential to enable his own Merciless. Pursuit is an alternative option here, taking advantage of it's ability to send most Psychic types running should it find itself an opportunity to come in safely against them. Drill Run should go to the last slot, allowing it to smash the many Steel types that want to eat it's STAB moves. The last slot is malleable, with options such as U-Turn to keep momentum going, Knock Off to remove Heavy Duty Boots and other key items, or Swords Dance to boost it's impressive attack to truly astounding levels.

    moves = Sludge Bomb / Weather Ball / Earth Power, Solarbeam, Synthesis / Leech Seed, Growth / Sleep Powder / Stun Spore 
   comment = Good bulk and access to Big Leaves enables Venusaur as a terrifying sweeper under Sun, gaining a 1.5 boost to both it's Speed and SpA stat as well as immunity to status effects. Solar Beam is generally the STAB of choice, and under sun is incredibly spammable. Sludge Bomb is a choice as a secondary STAB, with the ever present promise of a poison chance. Alternatively, Earth Power or Weather Ball offer it potential to hit Steel or Fire, which may otherwise threaten to wall this set. Synthesis is a fantastic option to keep Venusaur healthy, allowing it multiple opportunities to drop nukes, set up, or annoy the opponent with status. Leech Seed is a viable alternative here, although this can situationally leave Venusaur with zero longevity. For the last slot, some form of support is generally recommended, be it Growth to support itself or Status infliction to support it's team. A third attack is also a viable option, allowing it to surprise opponents with unexpected coverage. 252 SpA EVs and a modest nature serve to maximize Venusaur's raw damage output, while 152 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed up to and including Jolly/Timid Pokemon with base 110 Speed under sun.

   comment = The ability to set his own sun alongside Solar Power make Charizard Y into a powerful and self contained sun abuser. Fire Blast is a strong Fire STAB, although Flamethrower is a valid alternative if you prefer not to risk the miss. Dragon Pulse is a good, consistent Dragon STAB, although Draco Meteor is valid as well if you're willing to accept the drawbacks. Solarbeam is the coverage of choice, giving an option to hit the many Water/Fairy pokemon running around.

    moves = Hyper Voice, Hurricane, Heat Wave / Focus Blast, Roost / U-Turn 
   comment = The most basic of birds manages to establish itself as a somewhat respectable mega via it's ability in Majestic Bird greatly increasing it's SpA, complimented well by Keen Eye boosting the accuracy of Hurricane and Heat Wave. These two moves, alongside Hyper Voice form Pidgeots main attacking movepool, and he unfortunately has very little else to choose from as a special attacker. Focus Blast is worth considering, although similar to Hurricane it's accuracy remains low, and without the STAB boost behind it, it is generally an inferior option to Heat Wave. The last slot should go to U-Turn to generate momentum and pivot out of  bad matchups, although Roost is potentially worth considering to negate Pidgeots weakness to Stealth Rock. Do keep in mind that Pidgeot-mega remains relatively frail, so it will not be able to Roost off even reasonably strong neutral hits.

Scald forms the backbone of any defensive Water type, allowing them to not be entirely passive alongside a good chance to inflict Burn. Slack Off should be your next guaranteed pick, ensuring Slowbro remains healthy even if not able to immediately activate Regenerator. Toxic, Thunder Wave, or Yawn all offer additional status choices, allowing Slowbro to further cripple more threats, depending on what it's team needs most. For the last slot, Teleport is a fantastic option, allowing Slowbro to function as an excellent damage sponge while safely enabling it's frailer teammates to enter the field.

   comment = Use Twist. Dimension pre-mega to gain a Speed advantage. Set up either Amnesia or Iron Defense depending on their lead, and once you've gotten that to full then start setting up the next defensive stat. Once you get low you can just Slack Off. Due to Shell Armor you won't be able to get crit through your defenses, and Unaware means the opponent can't break through by setting up their offenses. Use either Body Press, Stored Power or Surf depending on the opponent.

Speed investments aren't needed because 1 Speed Boost is enough to outspeed unboosted Deoxys-Speed and scarfed Garchomp/Landorus. Thunder Fang as STAB, Ice Fang to deal with Ground/Grass, and last slot can pick between Roar for opposing boosting mon, Fire Fang for Ferrothorn, Psychic Fang for annoying screens.

   comment = Upon coming into the battle, Sandslash sneezing causes an 8 turn sandstorm, which benefits his Mega's innates. When he megas, he practically gets 182 Attack and 142 Speed from Sand Force and Sand Rush, which already sounds BUSTED before I explain what happens next. Slashy sets up a Swords Dance, and thanks to Sp.Def investment, lives any special water or grass type moves not spelled Hydro Pump or Leaf Storm. Desert Cloak prevents you from being GIMMICKED from any cheesers. After that, you know what to do. The Hash Slinging Slasher's Tough Claws make his 3 moves do even more damage. Ground and Rock coverage ensures he can hit every type for at least neutral damage. Something somehow outspeeds you? Rapid Spin it if you can, while also clearing entry hazards. They can't kill you if you quill em first.

Obstagoon has several tools at his disposal to deal with any situation he finds itself in. Bulk Up lets him be a bulky sweeper, Throat Chop to hinder the plethora of Sound-based attackers, switch his Toxic Orb for another beneficial item, or spread debuffs with Parting Shot and Obstruct(with the added benefit of letting him recover some damage with Poison Heal)

Additionally, Psychic Terrain helps Phermosa Greatly, as it disables priority attack moves from killing phermosa instantly. Protect and Substitute allows Phermosa to continously gain +1 speed.

Prio-Punches to deal with faster threats. Drain Punch combined with MMachamp's natural bulk allows it to get multiple KOs before going down(while also making it easier to get multiple Anger Point boosts).

   comment = Use Regenerator for pre-mega utility, however Poison Absorb is also a good choice depending on the rest of your team. Sludge Bomb for consistency, or Gunk Shot for more damage, too bad it doesn't get any poison stab that makes use of poison touch. Recover is for healing, Stockpile is to increase its longevity even more, and Protect is to rack up that passive damage from Toxic Spill and any poison you might get with your poison stab.

    comment = You get Plusle as early as Brawly, and thanks to Speed Boost, you're gonna have the ability to outspeed pretty much everything in the early, mid, and late game. Pixilate Uproar hits super hard, as do Transistor Thunderbolts. If your opponent is using a ground or poison move, just Volt Switch out of there into something that can tank it. In doubles, you can swap Uproar out with Swift if you want double target damage, and pairing Plusle up with a fellow Minun or other Plus/Minus pokemon like Raichu, Rotom, or Emolga can lead get some nasty sweeps.

    nature = Jolly / Adamant
    moves = Endure, Acrobatics, Night Slash, Extreme Speed
    comment = This set pretty much is a High Risk High Reward set as Endure is the main strategy, pairing it with weakness policy an Item that boosts your ATK and SpATK significantly. Although you shouldn't expect this set to work on every occasion or situation, do know that if you do get this set-up, which is very easy to do against specific Pokemon of course, this Pokemon will be dishing out massive damage. This Pokemon has quite the potential to deal massive damage to walls as well, so setting up hazards to chip away at the enemy HP may most likely KO due to Acrobatics + Weakness Policy. But of course if you decide to run Speed Force, I'd highly recommend running the Jolly Nature, and for Aerilate I'd suggest Adamant. Extreme Speed isn't just here for the Aerilate Bonus, it's pretty handy as a priority move to be able to allow Ninjask to move first against some Pokemon that like to rely on Priority, main weakness to this set of course is status and multi-hit moves as Ninjask will crumble.

    nature = Jolly/Naive
    moves = Protect/Iron Head/Iron Tail, Giga Drain/Leaf Storm, Draco Meteor, Protect
    comment = With Contrary as your ability to invert stat losses, this majestic serpent can be used in a versatile manner. Don't be deceived by Jolly nature and low EVs in SpAtk: Contrary Draco Meteor makes up for it as it increases the stat now twice per use. If your opponent is slower than you, Focus Sash allows you to use Draco Meteor at least once to raise ur SpAtk. Then you can finish your opponent with a more powerful Draco Meteor or another special move.
    With Big Root and increased SpAtk, you can now heal yourself at a Giga rate with Giga Drain! Use of Strength now increases your Defense and Special Defense which makes it more useful in covering your weakness for Bug/Flying/Ice type mons.
    If you are not comfortable with Jolly Nature, you can use Naive and Assault Vest to keep things balanced but you will have to replace Protect with an attacking move like Iron Head/Tail for Ice/Fairy types.
    Overall, if your team is slow and doesn't carry priority moves, this majestic serpent with mixed movesets can elegantly sweep your team and may even be at Full HP at the end of a battle.

Strength Sap is a must, as it both decreases your opponent's damage output and heals you more than Recover. Worry Seed can get rid of annoying abilities like Impenetrable or Tough Claws, while Giga Drain and Draining Kiss provide additional damage and a little extra healing.

   comment = Rapid Spin not only provides hazard support, but also gives Tsareena +2 speed due to hitting twice. This allows her to outspeed almost everything in the game (even with no Speed EVs!) and be nigh impossible to revenge kill thanks to Queenly Majesty. Wide Lens is the safer item choice, while Life Orb trades accuracy for power and synergizes well with Looter. Overall, if you're tired of using Grass-types that rely on Chlorophyll/sun, Tsareena might just be the Pokemon for you.

   comment = Water absorb is your answer to water type leads who you can set up on and use stored power to sweep after enough boosts. Drizzle pairs with hydration to prevent statuses while setting up, but Rain Dish is more optimal when the opponent’s lead already has Drizzle. When adding Draining Kiss for Dark type coverage and recovery, Vaporeon can sweep entire teams of water trainers and certain Team Aqua fights.

   comment = Breloom is an strong Swords Dance abuser that uses Toxic Boost Technician Bullet Seed to deal large amounts of damage and passively recovers because of Poison Heal. If you know that your opponent outspeeds you or that they are resistant to grass, you can use Mach Punch to hit them hard. With the exception of flying-types with priority such as Braviary or Dragonite, most flying Pokemon that threaten an OHKO on Breloom can be checked with Rock Tomb. If your opponent doesn't have any flying-type Pokémon, you can use Spore instead of Rock Tomb to make setting up easier.

Both Toxic and Knock Off can cripple a foe, but it depends on what Pokemon your opponent has. Use Knock Off for Heavy-Duty Boots users like Volcarona, Fearow, and Zapdos.

    nature = Jolly
    moves = Close Combat / Drain Punch, Seismic Fist, Ice Punch / Frustration, Meteor Mash / Power-Up Punch / Frustration
   comment = With the combination of Blitz Boxer, Power Fists, and Raging Boxer, Mega-Hotmonchan finds itself with the ability to both be a special sweeper and cleaner. 
   Drain Punch serves as a reliable STAB with the extra benefit of healing to stay healthy for Blitz Boxer's Priority. This pairs well with Power-Up Punch to boost it's attack to heal back it's lost health next turn.
   Close Combat is a more aggressive fighting STAB with immediate firepower that can clean unprepared teams in the late-game or sweep unboosted altogether.
   Seismic Fist works as it's ground STAB and pairs with Ice Punch for near perfect coverage. Frustration is sometimes prefered over over Ice Punch due the commodity of levitating ghost types (Aegislash, Rotoms, Chandelure, etc) immune to both of Hitmonchan-Mega's STABs.
   Power-Up Punch works with Raging Boxer to  raise its already high attack stat to absurd levels, while Meteor Mash or other coverage serve to hit resists that wall it otherwise.
   252 attack is to let Himonchan hit as hard as it can and 208 speed with a Jolly nature allows for it to outspeed Timid base 100s. 48 goes into its SpDef for extra bulk - it does not go into HP because it makes it harder to heal back to full with Drain Punch. With that being said, 44 of the SpDef evs can be re-invested into speed for easier cleaning with Close Combat
